You Are My Sunshine - 张靓颖 (Jane Zhang)

词：Jimmie Davis

曲：Jimmie Davis

You are my sunshine my only sunshine

You make me happy when skies are gray

You'll never know dear how much I love you

Please don't take my sunshine away

The other night dear as I lay sleeping

I dreamed I held you in my arm

When I awoke dear I was mistaken

So I hung my head and cried

You are my sunshine my only sunshine

You make me happy when skies are gray

You'll never know dear how much I love you

Please don't take my sunshine away

So please don't take my sunshine away
